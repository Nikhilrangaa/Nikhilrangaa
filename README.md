- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikhilrangaa
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the fascinating world of computer science, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, app development, and web design. I love the idea of creating technology that can improve everyday life and am always on the lookout for new challenges and projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  Python and JavaScript. Python's versatility and simplicity make it a great language for diving into programming concepts, and JavaScript is essential for web development. I'm also exploring basic machine learning principles to understand how AI can be integrated into various applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on open-source projects that are beginner-friendly and aimed at creating tools or apps that can help students. I'm also interested in joining hackathons or coding competitions that allow me to test my skills and learn from others in the community.
